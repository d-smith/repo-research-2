Notes:

library('dplyr')
ei <- select(stormdata,EVTYPE,FATALITIES, INJURIES, PROPDMG, CROPDMG)
by_evtype <- group_by(ei, EVTYPE)
fatalities <- summarise(by_evtype, count = n())

After grabbing the columns I wanted, grouping by event type, and counting fatalities,
I noticed several duplicate ways of naming the same things. One way this happended was with
differences in string case.

5  coastal flooding	2
56	Coastal Flooding	38
57	COASTAL FLOODING	143

The first grouping had 985 observations.

Normalizing case:

ei$EVTYPE <- toupper(ei$EVTYPE)
by_evtype <- group_by(ei, EVTYPE)
fatalities <- summarise(by_evtype, count = n())

Brings it down to 898. There's still a lot of overlap where the same item may have
been recorded using a slightly different event type, for example:

fatalities[28:36,]
